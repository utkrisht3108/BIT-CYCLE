 ### Description
 Our website provides a platform where bit-students can rent or buy cycles .It aims to serve as a network across the campus where students can interact and rent/buy cycles. â€‹

Our website provides a lot of features to enhance user experience and also maintain data integrity and security.
 ### Features:
 * A variety of filters to hep the user to find the ideal cycle.
 * Feedback from users after each transaction.(to avoid any false data-record).
 * Confirmation-emails.
 * Comments are stored for each cycle.
 * Ratings for every cycle that update after each feedback.
 * Chat feature to communicate/negotiate with owners.(live and completely functional).
 

 ### Scope of Improvement
 * We aim to add a wishlist feature which would keep track of the availability of our selected(prefered) cycles.
 * Integrate a payment gateway.
 
 We will be looking forward to implement these changes and actually implementing this idea in our campus.
